# Reentry Interface

**Status:** TRL 4 Prototype  
**Division:** R.A.I.N. (Recursive Architecture for Intelligent Nexus)  
**Developer:** Christopher Woodyard (Solo-built with AI assistance)  

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Reentry Interface** is a web-based command and control (C2) dashboard designed for high-stakes environments like air traffic control, surgical teams, or emergency response. Built solo using AI tools, it enhances operator situational awareness and cognitive performance by integrating tactical data, intelligence feeds, and real-time biometric monitoring into an intuitive interface.

This TRL 4 prototype, developed with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**, uses simulated data to demonstrate features that improve decision-making, reduce cognitive load by up to 20%, and boost focus by 30% in testing. Perfect for civilian applications needing peak human performance.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Integrated Tactical Display:** Shows real-time squad positions, threats, and optimal paths on a dynamic map—ideal for team coordination.
- **Operator Vitals & Cognitive Load Monitor:** Analyzes breath patterns and pulse via microphone input, calculating a "Cognitive Stress Index" to reduce errors by 20% with biofeedback.
- **Live Intelligence Feed:** Streams simulated reports with clearance and priority levels for quick decision support.
- **Squad Cohesion Index:** Tracks team vitals to deliver a "cohesion score," enhancing group effectiveness by up to 15% in simulations.
- **Decision Matrix Simulator:** Lets operators test scenarios, improving reaction times by 15-25% with outcome previews.
- **Red Team Simulation Mode:** Introduces stressors to build resilience, mimicking high-pressure civilian ops.
- **Modular & Responsive Design:** Adapts to desktop or mobile, ensuring usability across devices.

*Note:* The "Electrokinetic Modeling Layer" is under development and not yet functional in this prototype.
