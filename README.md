# Orpheus Resonance Protocol

**Status:** TRL 4 Prototype  
**Division:** R.A.I.N. (Recursive Architecture for Intelligent Nexus)  

---

## üß† Overview

The **Orpheus Resonance Protocol** is a perceptual AI interface designed to stabilize cognitive states under high-pressure conditions through **bio-symbolic entrainment**. It synchronizes user breath patterns with a symbolic starfield environment that responds in real-time, transforming physiological input into a **closed cognitive feedback loop**.

Rather than showing dashboards or alerts, Orpheus becomes the data‚Äîrendering **resonance fields**, **gesture-linked topologies**, and **attention-modulated environments**. This architecture enables **situational reset**, **focus continuity**, and **symbolic learning adaptation**.

## üîß System Components

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `breath_interface.py` | Extracts real-time breath patterns from audio stream |
| `reentry_engine.py` | Maps breath rhythm into symbolic harmonic space |
| `starfield_navigator.py` | Gesture-driven perceptual navigation interface |
| `resonance_feedback.py` | Audio-visual modulation loop |
| `state_logger.py` | Captures symbolic transitions and state coherence |
| `config.yaml` | Tunable parameters for resonance cycles and field dynamics |
