# Reentry Interface

**Status:** TRL 4 Prototype  
**Division:** R.A.I.N. (Recursive Architecture for Intelligent Nexus)  

---

## üß† Overview

The **Reentry Interface** is a next-generation, web-based command and control (C2) dashboard designed for high-stakes, information-rich environments. It serves as a powerful tool for enhancing the situational awareness and cognitive performance of a human operator.

This app fuses tactical data, intelligence feeds, and real-time biometric monitoring into a single, intuitive interface. By providing a holistic view of the operational landscape and the operator's own physiological state, the system aims to improve decision-making, reduce cognitive load, and increase mission effectiveness.

This project is a high-fidelity front-end prototype built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**. It uses simulated data to showcase its rich feature set and user experience.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Early Prototype

An early prototype of the core concepts, named **Rhythma**, was developed in Python with Gradio. It demonstrates the initial exploration into bio-symbolic entrainment and can be viewed here:

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Integrated Tactical Display:** Visualizes real-time positions of squad members, known threats, and AI-calculated optimal paths on a dynamic map.
*   **Operator Vitals & Cognitive Load Monitor:** Utilizes microphone input for real-time analysis of the operator's breath patterns and pulse rate, calculating a "Cognitive Stress Index" to provide bio-feedback.
*   **Live Intelligence Feed:** Displays a continuous stream of simulated intelligence reports, complete with clearance levels and priority rankings.
*   **Squad Cohesion Index:** Aggregates the vital signs and status of all squad members to provide a high-level "cohesion score," representing the team's overall effectiveness.
*   **Decision Matrix Simulator:** An interactive tool that allows operators to run through various scenarios and simulate the potential outcomes of their decisions.
*   **Red Team Simulation Mode:** A built-in training feature that introduces conflicting intelligence and other stressors to test and improve an operator's resilience to information warfare and high-pressure situations.
*   **Electrokinetic Modeling Layer:** A unique visualization layer that models complex data fields, potentially related to signal intelligence or the operator's own "bio-resonance frequency."
*   **Modular & Responsive Design:** The interface is built with a responsive layout that adapts to both desktop and mobile form factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

To run this application locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/topherchris420/orpheus-resonance-protocol.git
    cd orpheus-resonance-protocol
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (the port may vary).

### Other Available Scripts
