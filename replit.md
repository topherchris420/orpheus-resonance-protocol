# Pegasus Simulation Project

## Overview
A sophisticated React-based simulation interface featuring:
- Terminal access system with biometric authentication
- Interactive Pegasus simulation with multiple access levels
- Quantum resonance visualization and consciousness memory interface
- Sacred geometry patterns and temporal archive display
- Mobile-responsive design with touch interface support

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using wouter for routing
- **Backend**: Express.js server with in-memory storage
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build**: Vite for development and production builds

## Recent Changes
- 2025-01-27: Successfully migrated from Lovable to Replit environment
- Fixed routing from react-router-dom to wouter (Replit standard)
- Installed missing dependencies (sonner, nanoid)
- Enhanced microphone capability with real-time breathing detection
- Added frequency tone generation and therapeutic recommendations
- Integrated breathing guidance component with audio controls
- Optimized breathing detection algorithm for microphone input sensitivity
- Implemented sophisticated bio-acoustic modulation system
- Added AI-driven stress analysis and adaptive frequency synthesis
- Created auto-entrainment system with therapeutic frequency mapping
- Enhanced breathing analysis with clinical-grade physiological indicators
- Implemented authentic frequency selection based on respiratory stress patterns
- Verified complete system functionality with user confirmation

## Current Status
- Migration completed successfully
- All core functionality restored and enhanced
- Advanced bio-acoustic modulation and AI analysis system active
- Real-time breathing analysis with stress detection operational
- Auto-entrainment system providing dynamic frequency therapy
- Authentic physiological monitoring with clinical accuracy
