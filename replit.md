# Pegasus Simulation Project

## Overview
A sophisticated React-based simulation interface featuring:
- Terminal access system with biometric authentication
- Interactive Pegasus simulation with multiple access levels
- Quantum resonance visualization and consciousness memory interface
- Sacred geometry patterns and temporal archive display
- Mobile-responsive design with touch interface support

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using wouter for routing
- **Backend**: Express.js server with in-memory storage
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build**: Vite for development and production builds

## Recent Changes
- 2025-01-27: Successfully migrated from Lovable to Replit environment
- Fixed routing from react-router-dom to wouter (Replit standard)
- Installed missing dependencies (sonner, nanoid)
- Enhanced microphone capability with real-time breathing detection
- Added frequency tone generation and therapeutic recommendations
- Integrated breathing guidance component with audio controls
- Optimized breathing detection algorithm for microphone input sensitivity

## Current Status
- Migration completed successfully
- All core functionality restored and enhanced
- Advanced breathing analysis and tone therapy features active
- Real-time microphone breathing detection operational

## User Preferences
- Prefers comprehensive migration with security best practices
- Client/server separation requirements
- Fast and efficient adaptation to Replit environment
